::Shit, shit, shit! File is too large.::

Filtered data further on NYC Open Data to include 2013 to present. 

Downloaded data as CSV file.

Attempting to upload CSV file to RStudio (::prays::)

Womp womp. File is still too big.

Opened data in Excel to delete excess columns. Remaining columns are: Unique Key, Agency Name, Complaint Type, Descriptor, Location Type, Incident Zip, Incident Address, Address Type, City, and Borough

The date column — called "Created.Date" — includes a date and time stamp. 
To focus on date, I used Excel's "Format Cell" feature to keep the date info and eliminate time.

Used Excel's filter function to see borough-by-borough break down of rodent complaints. 
Findings include:
Total Cases — 75954
Bronx: 16688
Brooklyn: 23893
Manhattan: 18903
Queens: 12824
Staten Island: 4096

Filtered data on NYC Open Data to only show Brooklyn cases since the borough has highest number.

Downloaded data as CSV file.

Opened data in Excel and used the filter function to find out data based on years.
Findings include:
2015 — 9342
2014 — 7668
2013 — 6883

This shows an increase from 2013 to 2015.
